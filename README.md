[**Can AI really code? Study maps roadblocks to autonomous software engineering**](https://news.mit.edu/2025/can-ai-really-code-study-maps-roadblocks-to-autonomous-software-engineering-0716)

## What I Find Interesting  
This MIT article explores how far AI has come in writing code by itself and where it still struggles. It maps out concrete roadblocks—like understanding context, correcting ambiguous or incomplete requirements, and managing unintended side effects—that show autonomous coding isn’t just about generation but about alignment, safety, and feedback loops.

I find this fascinating because it strikes at the balance between innovation and caution. As AI tools get more powerful, it isn’t enough to just generate code; it’s also crucial to build systems that users can trust. For someone interested in software engineering, this article expands my perspective by showing that technical skill isn’t the only requirement: thoughtful design, human oversight, and robust tooling are equally important for scalable, reliable development.
